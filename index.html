			Hope this finds you surviving and thriving the steamy NYC (/wherever this message finds you) summer.

			In a couple weeks on July 28th, I’m turning 24, and Erika and I are looking to put together a festive moment with fun and friends and food, and I’d love for you to be there.
			<br>
			<br>
			As a reminder if you were around last year (and a summary if you weren’t), we had an awesome deal at a Latin restaurant in Park Slope called Palo Santo with ulimited tacos and drinks, a private patio, and an evening of merriment for $60 a head. We’re looking to put together a very similar deal at another place close by called Bar Basic this year with a similar menu—tacos, wine and beer, private garden etc (no further details on menu at the moment, but if anything weird comes up, we’re just gonna revert to the same Palo Santo deal as last year).
			<br>
			<br>
			Please let me know if this sounds doable for you and feel free to be frank if it’s not. We’d run it the same way we did last year where you Venmo Erika in advance so we can pay the restaurant and then everything’s already taken care of on the night. Please try to get back to me by Monday evening Jul 18 if possible, and that way we can start to coordinate more details around everyone’s needs and schedules.
